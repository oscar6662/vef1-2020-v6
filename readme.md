## Conclusion
Again, this has been another week full of sweat and furstration against all the possible odds and errors you can imagine.

But heyho, we made it. As I have understood this, I've translated the css files into scss in their correspondent files. I've installed node.js and a couple of plugins so that it is easier to edit the webpage.
Then at the end, uploaded it to a github repository and pray to god you like it.
